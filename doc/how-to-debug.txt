How to debug in Android Studio?

Do not try to "Select Device" to set the device. As long as the device is shown in Device Manager,
adb will be able to install the apk file.

# First install qr code scanner. It cannot be installed in onCreate() on 2025.12.22.

adb install src/main/assets/com.google.zxing.client.android.apk

Run under android-testdpc root folder:

rm -f bazel-bin/testdpc_debug.apk
bazel build //:testdpc_debug
adb install -r -t bazel-bin/testdpc_debug.apk

Then check the phone if it is installed.

# -w = wait for debugger
# The app will block at startup (before Application.onCreate())
adb shell am set-debug-app -w com.afwsamples.testdpc

# launch the app
adb shell am start -n com.afwsamples.testdpc/org.feitian.dpc.FirstActivity

In Android Studio, Run -> Attach Debugger to Android Process, select
com.afwsamples.testdpc to debug
